* Before we start, go to Project folder and edit pygmail.py file, filling gmailaddress and gmailpassword variables with a email and password, which are admin credentials for this project. We recommend creating & using a dummy Gmail for test purpose. Login, and go to Less Secure App Access and turn it ON to allow mail permissions.
* Go to Dialogflow Console & create a new project named Doctor_Chatbot. Click on the gear icon (next to project name), and import the Doctor_Chatbot.rar file (from repository) from the IMPORT FROM ZIP option available.
* Download ngrok. Open command prompt from that folder in which it's present, and execute ngrok http 5000 command. Copy the https link. Go back to Dialogflow project, click on Fulfillment tab and paste the link in the URL section followed by /webhook. Click SAVE button below.
* Go to Integration tab, click Web Demo and copy the url link. Replace this link in the Chatbot.html file, down below inside the iframe tag where the src url is present.
* Next, run connection.py file from the Project folder (repository). Open a browser, and enter localhost:5000 or 127.0.0.1:5000 to execute the interface.
* Watch this Full Project video to check how it is working.
